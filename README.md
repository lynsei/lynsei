# Lynsei

(◕‿◕) Hello! 


I'm a `very not famous` cryptography author, implementer, and software architect with over 20 years experience designing and building securely deployable, AG/ quasi-AG, adaptive, reactive, PreCQ and PCQ cryptographic implementations for multiple threshold distributed event systems scenarios, defending against many sorts of attacks & on many different threat surfaces, and using production-ready architecture for everything from mail-toasters to e-commerce software.  

All the software I produce is cloud based, and uses a custom policy framework to ensure it is compliant with FIPS-140(1-3), PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 9001 NIST standards.  All the architecture I produce is pre-validated by standards organizations and penetration tested, fuzzed (Gitlab, Dependabot, Peach, Synopsis/ Blackduck), with aut(h)onomic CI security scanners governed by policy adhesion for Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), multi-model threat paradigms, and following decrees instituted by the leaders in the industry and goverment experts with more modulous in their degrees than I have. But my modulous are the same as their modulous, just more cost effective.

## About those credentials...
 
Most persons who are doctoral students in cryptography don't create AWS architecture or write software systems in Rust/Go/Node/Typescript, etc. anyways, so I feel that I'm somewhat unique in the industry, although I'm certain there are many talented folk out there but I haven't met many in the crypto-sphere. 

That is of course with the exception of the folks with whom I interviewed at Google.  They were pretty staunch high-society dweebs, read from a robot script, and I know for a fact I didn't answer a single test question correct (was it the question about reproducing a red/black tree or trie tree from memory?), and so cheers to you Google! I may be too awful at tests, and too insecure to pass your programming exam, but I still have a Docker image running a software language interpreting files that use my name as the extension.  So I guess I'm doing *some* things right 🤏🏻!   

#### I'm all about the underdog! 
Never let **anyone** tell you what you "cannot do", folks (especially not Google)! 

I'm also all about representing and ...

### Advocating for strong cryptography

####  After all, crypto saved my life! 

  You see, I came before Aaron Swartz exactly 13 months prior in 2009.  Don't worry.  I'm not in jail so I obviously didn't do anything very interesting, but I *probably* would have wound up taking my own life too if the attempts to jail me for 30 years had been a success back then, and thankfully I deftly dodged those speculations and thereby a federal indictment.  One of the few!  
  
   This is how I learned that the NSA and FBI cannot break Blowfish-Rijndael-AES Weaved 512bit ciphers. Anyhow I don't want to overtly reminisce, but to make a very long story short, the FBI returned those hard drives to me two years later.  So by the grace of God and almost certainly my super-nifty cryptography, I remain free to this day.
   
> (For the record, I was innocent regardless.  The FBI didn't have a leg, or shall I say a log to stand on.  It took me many years to forget that incident and the person responsible.  But fortunately I'm a very forgiving individual.

Anyhow, that's enough about me!  My only credentials are the only ones this country has to offer in the realm of cryptography that aren't won from a university degree, and sometimes I wish I had gone that route.  Though, I do think there is a need for people who specialize in secure implementations of cryptography, and that's what I do.  Writing algorithms is important too, but most attacks are not on the crypto algorithm itself.  Anyhow, three letter organizations have no right to steal your computers and attempt to break in to your data, and yet the frequency with which this occurs would literally shock you.  The CFAA is the most abused document ever created in my opinion.  

For this reason I devote all my software to [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz).   May he rest in peace.

Always encrypt folks!  

> Because if "keeping you out of jail" isn't a good enough reason, I don't know what is!

PS:  You may say "Ah I'd never need to encrypt everything because I do nothing wrong.   Well do you trust everyone around you?   Do you trust everyone you work with?  You shouldn't be so trusting if you do.   All it takes is one failed business partnership, or one disgruntled employee to start a track with these sorts of agencies and they will literally cross major social boundaries in order to get what they want.  I'm proof of that.   So I know you may be a saint, but I thought I was too.  Success has hidden enemies, remember that!

My way of life now is to always just stay vigilant, and implement as much ZTA architecture as I can, both personally and professionally.  Trust is something that needs to constantly be evaluated, and so security should be fluid, dynamic, and highly segmented.
