(◕‿◕) Hello! 


I'm a `very not famous` cryptography author, implementer, and software architect with over 20 years experience designing and building securely deployable, AG/ quasi-AG, adaptive, reactive, PreCQ and PCQ cryptographic implementations for multiple threshold distributed event systems scenarios, defending against many sorts of attacks & on many different threat surfaces, and using production-ready architecture for everything from mail-toasters to e-commerce software.  

All the software I produce is cloud based, and uses a custom policy framework to ensure it is compliant with FIPS-140(1-3), PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 9001 NIST standards.  All the architecture I produce is pre-validated by standards organizations and penetration tested, fuzzed (Gitlab, Dependabot, Peach, Synopsis/ Blackduck), with aut(h)onomic CI security scanners governed by policy adhesion for Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), multi-model threat paradigms, and following decrees instituted by the leaders in the industry and goverment experts with more modulous in their degrees than I have. But my modulous are the same as their modulous, just more cost effective.

Most persons who are doctoral students in cryptography don't create AWS architecture or write software systems in Rust/Go/Node/Typescript, etc. anyways, so I feel that I'm fairly unique in the industry, although I'm certain there are many talented folk out there I just haven't met (many of) them yet. 

That is of course with the exception of the folks with whom I interviewed at Google.  They were pretty staunch high-society dweebs, read from a robot script, and I know for a fact I didn't answer a single answer to a test questions correct (was it the question about reproducing a red/black tree or trie tree from memory?), and so cheers to you Google!  After all, I may be too awful at tests, and too insecure to pass your programming exam, but I still have a Docker image running a software language interpreting files that use my name as the extension.  So I guess I'm doing *some* things right 🤏🏻!

* I'm all about the underdog!  Never let **anyone** tell you what you "cannot do", folks (especially not Google)! 
* I'm also all about representing and advocating for strong cryptography.  

#### After all, crypto saved my life! 

  You see, I came before Aaron Swartz exactly 13 months prior in 2009.  So I dedicate all my crypto to him!  I *probably* would have wound up taking my own life too if the attempts to jail me for 30 years had been a success back then, but thankfully I deftly dodged those speculations and thereby a federal indictment.  This is how I learned that the NSA and FBI cannot break Blowfish-Rijndael-AES Weaved 512bit ciphers. Anyhow I don't want to overtly reminisce, but to make a very long story short, the FBI returned those hard drives to me  two years later.  So by the grace of God and (almost certainly, mostly) modern cryptography, I remain free to this day.
> (I was innocent regardless, but it took me many years to forget that incident and the person responsible)

Anyhow, that's enough about me!  I'm just a nobody with the only credentials this country has to offer in the realm of cryptography, that aren't won from a university degree.   For this reason I devote all my software to [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz).   May he rest in peace.

Always encrypt folks!  

> Because if "keeping you out of jail" isn't a good enough reason, I don't know what is!
