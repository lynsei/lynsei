# Lynsei

(◕‿◕) Hello! 


I'm a `very not famous` cryptography author, implementer, and software architect with over 20 years experience designing and building securely deployable, AG/ quasi-AG, adaptive, reactive, PreCQ and PCQ cryptographic implementations for multiple threshold distributed event systems scenarios, defending against many sorts of attacks & on many different threat surfaces, and using production-ready architecture for everything from mail-toasters to e-commerce software.  

All the software I produce is cloud based, and uses a custom policy framework to ensure it is compliant with FIPS-140(1-3), PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 9001 NIST standards.  All the architecture I produce is pre-validated by standards organizations and penetration tested, fuzzed (Gitlab, Dependabot, Peach, Synopsis/ Blackduck), with aut(h)onomic CI security scanners governed by policy adhesion for Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), multi-model threat paradigms, and following decrees instituted by the leaders in the industry and goverment experts with more modulous in their degrees than I have. But my modulous are the same as their modulous, just more cost effective.

## About those credentials...
 
Most persons who are doctoral students in cryptography don't create AWS architecture or write software systems in Rust/Go/Node/Typescript, etc. anyways, so I feel that I'm somewhat unique in the industry, although I'm certain there are many talented folk out there but I haven't met many in the crypto-sphere. 

That is of course with the exception of the folks with whom I interviewed at Google.  They were pretty staunch high-society dweebs, read from a robot script, and I know for a fact I didn't answer a single answer to a test questions correct (was it the question about reproducing a red/black tree or trie tree from memory?), and so cheers to you Google!  After all, I may be too awful at tests, and too insecure to pass your programming exam, but I still have a Docker image running a software language interpreting files that use my name as the extension.  So I guess I'm doing *some* things right 🤏🏻!

I'm all about the underdog!  Never let **anyone** tell you what you "cannot do", folks (especially not Google)! 
I'm also all about representing and advocating for strong cryptography.  

#### After all, crypto saved my life! 

  You see, I came before Aaron Swartz exactly 13 months prior in 2009.  So I dedicate all my crypto to him!  I *probably* would have wound up taking my own life too if the attempts to jail me for 30 years had been a success back then, but thankfully I deftly dodged those speculations and thereby a federal indictment.  This is how I learned that the NSA and FBI cannot break Blowfish-Rijndael-AES Weaved 512bit ciphers. Anyhow I don't want to overtly reminisce, but to make a very long story short, the FBI returned those hard drives to me  two years later.  So by the grace of God and (almost certainly, mostly) modern cryptography, I remain free to this day.
> (I was innocent regardless, but it took me many years to forget that incident and the person responsible)

Anyhow, that's enough about me!  I'm just a nobody with the only credentials this country has to offer in the realm of cryptography, that aren't won from a university degree.   For this reason I devote all my software to [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz).   May he rest in peace.

Always encrypt folks!  

> Because if "keeping you out of jail" isn't a good enough reason, I don't know what is!
