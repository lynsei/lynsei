(◕‿◕) Hello! 


I'm a `very not famous` cryptography author, implementer, and software architect with over 20 years experience designing and building securely deployable, AG/ quasi-AG, adaptive, reactive, PreCQ and PCQ cryptographic implementations for multiple threshold distributed event systems scenarios, defending against many sorts of attacks & on many different threat surfaces, and using production-ready architecture for everything from mail-toasters to e-commerce software.  

All the software I produce is cloud based, and uses a custom policy framework to ensure it is compliant with FIPS-140(1-3), PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 9001 NIST standards.  All the architecture I produce is pre-validated by standards organizations and penetration tested, fuzzed (Gitlab, Dependabot, Peach, Synopsis/ Blackduck), with aut(h)onomic CI security scanners governed by policy adhesion for Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), multi-model threat paradigms, and following decrees instituted by the leaders in the industry and goverment experts with more modulous in their degrees than I have. But my modulous are the same as their modulous, just more cost effective.
